        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an <br> amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the <br> free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks <br> was the best - and most grueling - time of my <br> life. Since completing
        the course, I've <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
        learning from their experiences was easy.

        “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a <br> former 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
        100% recommend! ”
